# Teeny Tiny Compyler
This is a 500 line compiler written in python which compiles a BASIC like language to C code.

This is from [this tutorial (part 1)](https://austinhenley.com/blog/teenytinycompiler1.html) by Austin Z. Henley

[Part 2: parsing grammar](https://austinhenley.com/blog/teenytinycompiler2.html)
[Part 3: emitting code](https://austinhenley.com/blog/teenytinycompiler3.html)

Future Considerations:
- Parentheses for expressions
- Logical operators (and, or, not)
- ELSE IF and ELSE
- FOR loop
- Number literals written in binary, hex, and octal
- Better compiler errors (e.g., what line the error occurred)
- Allow multiple code files
- Functions with parameters and return values
- Lexical scope (see [scope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_\(computer_science\)))
- Standard library (e.g., file operations)
- [Abstract syntax tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) representation
- More primitive types (e.g., integer, strings, boolean)
- Arrays
- Record types (i.e., structs or tuples)
- Type checking (see [type systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system))
- Compiler optimizations (e.g., [constant folding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_folding))
- Test cases for the compiler (see [unit testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) and [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development))
